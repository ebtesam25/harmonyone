# FitBet
FitBet allows developers to stay fit by setting fitness and productivity goals and betting on them.
- Step 1: Connect to Github - this will be used to track your commits/activity
- Step 2: Connect to FitBit - this will be used to track your fitness goals and stats such as calorie intake, steps taken, active minutes
- Step 3: Connect to your Harmony Wallet - Export your wallet on the web and scan the QR code on your mobile device.
- Step 4: Place a bet. How many ONEs are you willing to bet that you can reach your fitness and productivity goals for this week?
This is placed into a pool of funds for the duration of the bet. When the timer ends, the funds are distributed based on the users' outcomes respectively. 
- Users who failed to reach their goals lose their portion of the bet. This is distributed to users who managed to exceed their fitness goals.
- Users who reached their goals get their portion of the bet back.
They can use their funds to mint NFTs which can be used as 'bonus lives' in case users fail to reach their target.
